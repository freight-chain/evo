# Regulatory Filings for EVO-enabled Forward Contracts

> embedded volumetric optionality contracts and regulatory process we are undertaking to enable physical delivery settlement of commodities on-chain

Freight Trust Network is ecosystem for supply chain and digital freight management. By building off of our "loadboard" integrations, Freight Trust enables not only the digitization of legacy business processes, it also enables the tokenization of real world, physically settled commodities for SMEs globally by reducing counter-party default risk while also ensuring physical delivery. 

Futures contracts on commodities differ from plain vanilla options on stocks. While stocks and other underlying exchange traded securities can be easily bought and sold electronically with electronic settlement, futures contracts require the tracking of physical inventory.
